# Hackathon: Machine Learning Methods for Overlapping Signals

## Event Overview

This hackathon brings together experts from astrophysics, signal processing, and machine learning to advance the state-of-the-art in gravitational wave data analysis. We aim to develop novel approaches to the source confusion problem in LISA data—a critical challenge for maximizing the scientific potential of the LISA mission.

### What to Expect

The event will feature:

- Keynote talks on machine learning, Bayesian inference, and gravitational wave astronomy
- Hands-on tutorials on simulation-based inference and deep learning techniques
- Team-based projects addressing real LISA data analysis challenges
- Collaborative sessions with early-career researchers and senior experts
- Networking and interdisciplinary collaboration

### Why This Matters

The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will be the first space-based gravitational wave observatory, opening a new observational window in the millihertz frequency regime. To fully exploit LISA's scientific potential, we need to extract meaningful signals from a complex mixture of noise and overlapping signals—much like distinguishing individual conversations in a crowded bar.

Current Bayesian inference methods, while effective, face significant scalability challenges that make them impractical for analyzing full mission data. This hackathon aims to develop machine learning approaches that combine the speed of neural networks with the statistical rigor of Bayesian inference.
